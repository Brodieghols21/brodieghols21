## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brodie Gholson and I'm a Senior at Southern Arkansas University, soon to graduate from Computer Science! I'm really passionate about Python and Java, and all things that make my brain tick!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Minecraft Mobs and other fun projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to solve a variety of challenging problems on platforms such as LeetCode and HackerRank to hone my problem-solving skills.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: brodiegholson0@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜™ Fun fact: Don't let me say it without asking - where's the fun in that?
